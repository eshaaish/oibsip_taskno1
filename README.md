My oasis infobyte java internship task
I created number guessing game using java. In this game, the computer generates a random number and the user has to guess it and if the number is higher or lower than the generated number then the computer will prompt accordingly.
The fun and easy project "Guess the Number" is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer & involves the following steps:
1. The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100.
2. The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box.
3. The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number.
4. The game continues under the user guessing the number.
